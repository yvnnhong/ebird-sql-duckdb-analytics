# eBird SQL DuckDB Analytics

## Focus: Species Ecology, Conflict, and Conservation in California 

## Project Overview
Comprehensive analysis of bird population dynamics, breeding patterns, and conservation outcomes in California using large-scale eBird citizen science data (2005-2025). I requested a custom download of 47GB of bird observation data in California from Cornell's eBird api from 2005-2025 to examine three distinct ecological niches across multiple species, providing insights into urban adaptation, conservation effectiveness, and climate resilience in California's diverse avian communities.

## Research Scope
**Dataset**: 47GB eBird observation data from Cornell Lab eBird API  
**Geographic Focus**: California statewide  
**Temporal Scope**: ~21 years (2005-2025)  
**Analysis Platform**: DuckDB SQL queries 
**Species Coverage**: Urban adapters, endangered species, and endemic specialists  

## Study Components

### 1. **Urban Adaptation Comparative Study**
**Folder**: [`house_finch_vs_house_sparrow/`](house_finch_vs_house_sparrow/)

**Research Question**: How do two historically successful urban-adapted species respond differently to California's changing urban landscapes?

**Species Analyzed**:
- **House Finch** (*Haemorhous mexicanus*) - Native California species
- **House Sparrow** (*Passer domesticus*) - Introduced European species

**Key Findings**:
- **House Finch dominance**: 87.1% of observations (134.4M birds vs 19.9M sparrows)
- **Urban adaptation reversal**: House Sparrows declining (-31.7%) while House Finches increase (+133.6%)
- **Geographic displacement**: Sparrows show range contraction in major metropolitan areas
- **Breeding success differential**: Finches maintain 44.6% success vs Sparrows' 41.0% in urban environments

**Conservation Implications**: Native species may outcompete introduced species in mature urban environments, suggesting urban habitat management can favor native biodiversity.

### 2. **Endangered Species Conservation Assessment**
**Folder**: [`ridgways_rail/`](ridgways_rail/)

**Research Question**: How effective have large-scale habitat restoration programs been for endangered species recovery?

**Species Analyzed**:
- **Ridgway's Rail** (*Rallus obsoletus*) - Endangered California marsh endemic

**Key Findings**:
- **Dramatic population recovery**: 4,456% increase (390 to 17,758 birds observed annually)
- **Geographic expansion**: 3,880% increase in occupied localities (58 to 2,261 sites)
- **Conservation success by region**: San Francisco Bay Area shows coordinated improvement across multiple counties
- **Habitat restoration effectiveness**: Counties with active salt pond restoration programs show highest recovery rates

**Conservation Implications**: Large-scale, coordinated habitat restoration programs can achieve remarkable endangered species recovery when sustained over multi-decade timeframes.

### 3. **Endemic Species Climate Resilience Study**
**Folder**: [`yellow_billed_magpie/`](yellow_billed_magpie/)

**Research Question**: How do endemic species adapt to climate variability, and what factors drive range expansion?

**Species Analyzed**:
- **Yellow-billed Magpie** (*Pica nuttalli*) - California Central Valley endemic

**Key Findings**:
- **Active range expansion**: 53.8% of breeding counties represent recent colonizations (2020+)
- **Climate stability**: Breeding success remains stable (19-22%) across all climate conditions
- **Year-round breeding**: Unique extended breeding season unlike most temperate species
- **Observer behavior insights**: Climate affects citizen science data collection more than actual bird biology

**Conservation Implications**: Endemic species can demonstrate remarkable climate resilience and adaptive capacity when suitable habitat corridors exist for range expansion.
