/*YELLOW-BILLED MAGPIE CORE BREEDING BEHAVIORS BY SEASON*/
/*
Goal of this query: Identify the top 3 breeding behaviors (codes) for each season across 
47GB California bird sightings dataset (2015â€“2025), excluding non-breeding behaviors 
and noise (e.g., flyovers).
*/

--THIS ONE BELOW ACTUALLY WORKS 
-- Top breeding codes for each season (fall, winter, spring, summer)
-- Excludes flyovers and non-breeding behaviors
-- Modified version with broader exclusions
