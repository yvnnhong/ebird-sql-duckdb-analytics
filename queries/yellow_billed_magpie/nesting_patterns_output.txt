(note: This query aggregates ALL observations from 2015-2025)
this is the output for the breeding codes for the yellow billed magpie. 
It shows the top 3 breeding codes for each season. 

Yellow-billed Magpie Seasonal Breeding Patterns
Fall (Sep-Nov)

NB (21) - Nest Building: Constructing new nests
CN (19) - Carrying Nesting Material: Gathering twigs, mud for nests
ON (6) - Occupied Nest: Active nests with incubating parents

Spring (Mar-May) - Peak Breeding Season

NB (190) - Nest Building: Major nest construction activity
ON (169) - Occupied Nest: High number of active nests
CN (120) - Carrying Nesting Material: Intensive material gathering

Summer (Jun-Aug) - Raising Young

FL (38) - Recently Fledged Young: Young birds just left nest
ON (17) - Occupied Nest: Some continued nesting
FY (9) - Feeding Young: Adults feeding dependent fledglings

Winter (Dec-Feb) - Unexpected Activity

NB (75) - Nest Building: Surprising winter nest construction
CN (52) - Carrying Nesting Material: Winter material gathering
ON (31) - Occupied Nest: Some winter nesting activity

Key Finding: Spring shows peak breeding (479 total observations), but 
significant winter activity (158 observations) suggests possible 
year-round breeding or cache-building behavior.

---------- NOTE: PUT EVERYTHING INTO A README

Analysis & Observations:
Spring as Prime Breeding Season (479 total observations)

Spring shows 7.5x more breeding activity than summer
Peak nest building (NB=190) indicates primary breeding initiation
High occupied nest count (ON=169) confirms successful breeding establishment
This aligns with typical corvid breeding patterns in California's Mediterranean climate

Summer's Counterintuitive Low Activity (64 total observations)

Despite being endemic to California, summer shows fewest breeding observations
FL (Recently Fledged Young) as #1 behavior confirms post-breeding dispersal
Low ON (17) indicates most young have left nests by summer
Behavioral shift from stationary nest-based to mobile family group activities
Observer detection bias: harder to spot mobile fledglings vs. fixed nests

Nest Building Dominance Across Seasons

NB ranks #1 in Spring, Fall, and Winter (absent only in Summer)
Suggests continuous territory maintenance and nest preparation
Multiple nest construction may serve non-breeding functions (roosting, caching)

Unexpected Winter Breeding Activity (158 observations)

Substantial winter nesting contradicts typical temperate bird patterns
May indicate: (1) mild California winters allow extended breeding, (2) cache/roost site 
preparation, or (3) early breeding preparation
Warrants further investigation into actual reproductive success vs. nest-building behavior

Breeding Code Patterns by Season:

Fall/Winter: Preparation behaviors (NB, CN) dominate
Spring: Peak reproductive activity (NB, ON, CN)
Summer: Post-breeding dispersal (FL, FY) with mobile young

This data reveals Yellow-billed Magpies follow a classic post-breeding dispersal pattern 
with potential year-round territorial maintenance unique to California's stable climate.
