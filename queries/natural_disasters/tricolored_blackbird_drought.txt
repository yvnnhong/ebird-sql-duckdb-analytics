# Tricolored Blackbird Drought Impact Analysis
## California Drought 2015-2017: Habitat Compression Effects

**Dataset**: 47GB eBird observation data | **Species**: Tricolored Blackbird | **Period**: 2013-2020  
**Key Finding**: Drought caused habitat compression, not population decline

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 47GB of California bird observation data reveals that the 2015-2017 drought 
significantly impacted tricolored blackbirds through **habitat compression** rather 
than simple population decline. Birds concentrated into larger flocks at fewer 
remaining suitable sites, demonstrating classic ecological stress responses.

## Key Evidence: Habitat Compression During Drought

### 1. Dramatically Larger Flock Sizes
- **Drought**: 133.8 birds/flock vs **Non-Drought**: 93.86 birds/flock
- **42% increase** in average flock size during drought years
- Median remained stable (10 birds), indicating extreme outliers driving the average

### 2. Extreme Large Flock Formation
- **95th percentile**: 350 â†’ 550 birds (**57% increase**)
- **Maximum observed**: 20,000 birds (drought) vs 15,000 (non-drought)
- Clear evidence of birds concentrating at remaining water sources

### 3. Higher Mega-Flock Concentration Rates
- **Total observations**: 12,742 (drought) vs 21,031 (non-drought) - **40% fewer sightings**
- **Mega-flocks (1000+ birds)**: 396 vs 432 - nearly identical despite fewer total observations
- **Mega-flock rate**: 3.1% (drought) vs 2.1% (non-drought) - **48% higher rate**
- **Large flock rate (500+)**: 6.3% vs 3.9% - **62% higher rate**

## Analysis Results by Query

### Query 1: Breeding Stress Indicators
**Pattern**: Erratic breeding activity during drought period
- **2015**: 1.22% breeding observations
- **2016**: 1.49% breeding observations  
- **2017**: 3.79% breeding observations (**158% spike**)

**Interpretation**: The dramatic spike in 2017 suggests either:
- Desperate breeding attempts as conditions slightly improved
- Concentration effects making breeding behavior more visible to observers

### Query 2: Habitat Compression Evidence  
**Pattern**: Clear aggregation into fewer, more crowded locations
- **42% larger** average flock sizes during drought
- **Higher rates** of mega-flocks despite fewer total observations
- **Stable medians** but **elevated averages** = extreme outlier formation

## Ecological Interpretation

### What Happened
During the 2015-2017 California drought, tricolored blackbirds experienced **habitat compression**:
- Wetlands and suitable foraging areas dried up
- Birds concentrated at remaining water sources and irrigated areas
- Formed larger, denser flocks at fewer locations
- Created more visible mega-colonies (1000+ birds)

### Why This Matters
This represents a **textbook case** of drought impact on colonial waterbirds:
- Not simple population decline, but behavioral/spatial adaptation
- Higher density aggregations may increase disease transmission risk
- Concentrated populations more vulnerable to single-point failures
- Demonstrates species resilience and adaptive capacity
