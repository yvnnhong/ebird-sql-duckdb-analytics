Analysis Summary:
- Total Ridgway's Rail records analyzed: 44,248
- Records containing Atlas Block data: 0 (0.0%)
- Unique Atlas Blocks identified: 0

Conclusion:
Atlas Block data is not available in this eBird dataset for Ridgway's Rail observations. 
Alternative geographic analysis methods using locality IDs and coordinate-based grid 
systems should be used for range expansion studies.

Note: Atlas Blocks are typically populated in specialized breeding bird survey datasets 
rather than general eBird citizen science data. For fine-scale geographic analysis, 
refer to geographic_expansion_localities.sql which uses coordinate grids and locality data.
