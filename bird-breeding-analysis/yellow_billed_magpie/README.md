#### **Observer Effort Patterns by Climate**
| Climate Type | Unique Locations | Total Observations | Obs/Location | Success Rate |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Drought/Hot** | 250 | 637 | 2.55 | 19.15% |
| **Normal** | 123 | 307 | 2.50 | 21.50% |
| **Wet/Cool** | 91 | 186 | 2.04 | 19.35% |

#### **Climate Analysis Insights**
**üîç Observer Behavior > Bird Biology:**
- **Drought years**: Highest observer effort (250 locations, 637 observations)
- **Wet years**: Lowest observer effort (91 locations, 186 observations) 
- **Consistent success rates**: 19-22% across all climate types
- **2021 spike**: 460 observations during drought year (likely pandemic-related increased birding)

**üå°Ô∏è Climate Stability:**
Yellow-billed Magpie breeding success remains remarkably **stable across climate conditions** (19-22%), suggesting strong adaptation to California's variable climate patterns.

**üìä Data Quality Finding:**
Climate affects **citizen science data collection patterns** more than actual bird breeding success - drought years see increased observer participation and geographic coverage.

### **Seasonal Breeding Patterns**

#### **Spring: Peak Breeding Season** (479 observations)
- **190 Nest Building** - Primary breeding season begins
- **169 Occupied Nests** - High nesting success rate  
- **120 Carrying Nesting Material** - Intensive preparation activity

#### **Summer: Post-Breeding Dispersal** (64 observations)
- **38 Recently Fledged Young** - Young birds leaving nests
- **17 Occupied Nests** - Late-season breeding attempts
- **9 Feeding Young** - Adults caring for dependent offspring

#### **Winter: Unexpected Activity** (158 observations)
- **75 Nest Building** - Surprising winter construction
- **52 Carrying Nesting Material** - Off-season preparation
- **31 Occupied Nests** - Potential mild-weather breeding

#### **Fall: Territory Maintenance** (46 observations)
- **21 Nest Building** - Continued territorial behavior
- **19 Carrying Nesting Material** - Preparation for winter
- **6 Occupied Nests** - Extended breeding season

### **Geographic Distribution & Range Expansion**

#### **Dramatic Range Expansion** (2020-2025)
- **14 counties** show recent colonization (first observed 2020+)
- **53.8% of all breeding counties** are newly established territories
- **Northward expansion** documented: Shasta (2024), Butte (2020), Nevada (2020)
- **Eastward expansion** into Sierra Nevada foothills: Calaveras, Amador, Nevada
- **Southern expansion** continues: Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara

#### **New Territory Success Patterns**
**üèÜ Highly Successful New Colonies:**
- **Calaveras**: 100% success (2021 colonization, 35 observations)
- **Madera**: 100% success (2024 colonization, 15 observations)  
- **Colusa**: 66.7% success (2021-2025, 126 observations)
- **Yuba**: 50% success (2021-2023, 12 observations)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Struggling New Territories:**
- **Sutter**: 0% success (2022 only, 12 observations)
- **Amador**: 0% success (2021 only, 24 observations)
- **Placer**: 9.7% success (2020-2024, 105 observations)

#### **Established Population Centers**
**üéØ Core Breeding Areas:**
- **Sacramento**: 2,984 observations (Urban/Suburban, 34.3% success)
- **Yolo**: 752 observations (Rural, 33.6% success, 2013-2025)
- **Stanislaus**: 560 observations (Rural, 45.8% success, 2017-2025)

**üåü High-Performing Stable Counties:**
- **San Luis Obispo**: 54.4% success (2018-2024, 155 observations)
- **Monterey**: 52.1% success (2016-2024, 168 observations)
- **San Benito**: 45.3% success (2016-2025, 175 observations)

#### **Conservation Status by Region**
- **Recent Colonization**: 14 counties (53.8%) - Active expansion phase
- **Stable Range**: 11 counties (42.3%) - Established breeding populations  
- **Possible Abandonment**: 1 county (3.8% - Contra Costa, 2013 only)

#### **Habitat Preferences**
- **Rural dominance**: 96.2% of breeding counties (25/26)
- **Limited urban adaptation**: Only Sacramento shows urban breeding success
- **Agricultural landscapes**: High success in Central Valley counties
- **Foothill expansion**: Growing presence in Sierra Nevada foothills

## Conservation Insights

**üîç Seasonal Patterns:**
- **Year-round breeding activity** unlike most temperate birds
- **Spring dominance** with 7.5x more activity than summer
- **Winter nesting** suggests climate adaptation advantages

**üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Expansion:**
- **Active northward expansion** with 53.8% of counties recently colonized
- **High success in new territories** indicates suitable habitat availability
- **Rural habitat preference** (96.2% of breeding locations)
- **Limited urban adaptation** (only Sacramento classified as urban)

**üå°Ô∏è Climate Adaptation:**
- **Stable breeding success** across all climate conditions (19-22%)
- California's mild winters allow extended breeding seasons
- **Climate resilience** gives competitive advantages over migratory species
- **Observer bias awareness**: Climate affects data collection more than bird biology

**üìä Observer Detection:**
Summer's low numbers likely reflect **post-breeding dispersal** rather than reduced activity - mobile family groups are harder to detect than stationary nests.
