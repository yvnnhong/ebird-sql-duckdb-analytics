# Yellow-billed Magpie Breeding Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of Yellow-billed Magpie breeding patterns using eBird data (2015-2025). This endemic California species shows unique year-round breeding activity adapted to the state's Mediterranean climate.

## Key Findings

### **Spring: Peak Breeding Season** (479 observations)
- **190 Nest Building** - Primary breeding season begins
- **169 Occupied Nests** - High nesting success rate  
- **120 Carrying Nesting Material** - Intensive preparation activity

### **Summer: Post-Breeding Dispersal** (64 observations)
- **38 Recently Fledged Young** - Young birds leaving nests
- **17 Occupied Nests** - Late-season breeding attempts
- **9 Feeding Young** - Adults caring for dependent offspring

### **Winter: Unexpected Activity** (158 observations)
- **75 Nest Building** - Surprising winter construction
- **52 Carrying Nesting Material** - Off-season preparation
- **31 Occupied Nests** - Potential mild-weather breeding

### **Fall: Territory Maintenance** (46 observations)
- **21 Nest Building** - Continued territorial behavior
- **19 Carrying Nesting Material** - Preparation for winter
- **6 Occupied Nests** - Extended breeding season

## Conservation Insights

**üîç Unique Patterns:**
- **Year-round breeding activity** unlike most temperate birds
- **Spring dominance** with 7.5x more activity than summer
- **Winter nesting** suggests climate adaptation advantages

**üå°Ô∏è Climate Adaptation:**
California's mild winters allow extended breeding seasons, giving Yellow-billed Magpies competitive advantages over migratory species.

**üìä Observer Detection:**
Summer's low numbers likely reflect **post-breeding dispersal** rather than reduced activity - mobile family groups are harder to detect than stationary nests.
