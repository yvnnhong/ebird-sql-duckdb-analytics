Proper order of clauses in a basic SQL SELECT statement:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column

Definitions: 

SELECT — What columns do you want to retrieve?

FROM — Which table(s) are you selecting from?

WHERE — Filter rows based on conditions.

GROUP BY — Group rows that have the same values in specified columns.

HAVING — Filter groups (used with GROUP BY).

ORDER BY — Sort the results.

Simple Example: 
SELECT name, age
FROM users
WHERE age IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY age DESC;
